# POStagging

multiPOS1910s.R takes in a corpus, in this case, supreme court cases from the 1910s. it cleans them, tags every word's part of speech, and returns the results in two ways: a master dataframe that contains percentages (eg, % adjectives, # of words) and accompanying textfiles of "tags" that contain each of the case's adjectives, adverbs and gerunds (the form-classes of interest in my work) in easy to view, "tagged" form.
